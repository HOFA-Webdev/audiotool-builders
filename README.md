# Instructions

1. Clone this repo, and navigate into the folder for the tool you want to build.
1. Run `yarn build`, and go brew some coffeeâ€”this will take a while!
1. Run `yarn install`, which will copy the compiled binary into a `bin` folder in the current directory.
1. Finally, run `yarn clean` to remove the Docker container (this won't remove the binary file you just built).
